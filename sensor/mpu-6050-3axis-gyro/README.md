### description from vendor

Description:

Name: MPU-6050 module (three-axis gyroscope + triaxial accelerometer)
2.54mm pin spacing
MPU-6050 Accelerometer + Gyro
The MPU-6050 sensor contains a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro in a single chip. It is very accurate, since it contains 16-bits analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel. Therefor it captures the x, y, and z channel at the same time.

Specification:

16bit AD converter-chip, 16-bit data output
Use Chip: MPU-6050
Power supply :3-5v (internal low dropout regulator)
Communication: IIC communication protocol standard
Gyro Range: ± 250 500 1000 2000 ° / s
Acceleration range: ± 2 ± 4 ± 8 ± 16g
Using Immersion Gold PCB, welding machines to ensure quality
Size: 2 x 1.6 x 0.1cm
